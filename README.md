## Description

The application is a landing page for Horiseon that allows users to navigate through content advertised by the company including Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. HTML and CSS have been refactored to meet accessibility standards and become optimized for search engines. I added semantic HTML elements, followed a logical structure independent of position and styling, added accessible alt atributes to icons and images, changed the heading attributes to fall in sequential order, wrote a concise and descriptive title, corrected links to ensure they functioned correctly, consolidated the selectors and properties in CSS to increase efficiency, and included comments.
