# Horiseon Refactor

## Description

In order to create a codebase that meets accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines, I did the following:
- added semantic HTML elements, 
- followed a logical structure independent of position and styling, 
- added accessible alt atributes to icons and images, 
- changed the heading attributes to fall in sequential order, 
- wrote a concise and descriptive title, 
- corrected links to ensure they functioned correctly, 
- consolidated the selectors and properties in CSS to increase efficiency, 
- and included comments.
